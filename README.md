  Identify key variables such as sales amounts, product categories, customer demographics, and time-related data.
Data Preprocessing:

- Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
Convert data types, encode categorical variables, and create new features if necessary.
Sales Performance Analysis:

- Analyze overall sales performance over time to identify trends and seasonal patterns.
Segment sales data by product categories to determine which products are performing well and which are underperforming.
Evaluate sales performance across different regions or customer segments.
Customer Behavior Analysis:

- Analyze customer purchasing behavior to identify patterns and preferences.
Segment customers based on purchasing frequency, average order value, and other relevant metrics.
Determine the lifetime value of customers and identify high-value customers.
